**name** | **str** | The discount&#39;s name. | [optional] 
**type** | **str** | The type of the discount. If it is created by API, it would be either &#x60;FIXED_PERCENTAGE&#x60; or &#x60;FIXED_AMOUNT&#x60;.

Represents the amount of money applied to a line item as a discount When an amount-based discount is at order-level, this value is different from &#x60;amount_money&#x60; because the discount is distributed across the line items. | [optional]
